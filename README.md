⚙️ SvetLuna Hybrid Atmospheric Installation  
Core research project — 2025  

🌩️ Overview  
The Hybrid Atmospheric Installation is an experimental system designed to capture and store atmospheric electric energy via controlled corona discharge and resonant accumulation.  
The project combines principles of electrical engineering, atmospheric physics, and resonance-based energy modeling.

🧩 System Architecture  

- Corona wire — high-voltage emitter for atmospheric ionization  
- Atmospheric electrodes — field collectors and charge transfer nodes  
- Mast insulation — multi-layer dielectric isolation  
- Current-limited rectifiers — safe conversion of atmospheric current  
- Measuring shunt & damper — current sensing and protection  
- Resonance circuit — frequency-matched phase loop  
- Charge controller — regulated energy flow  
- Supercapacitor block — fast-response accumulator  
- LiFePO₄ battery — long-term storage  
- DC outputs 12 V / 24 V — power delivery for loads

## 🐍 Python model

The repository also contains a small Python model of the hybrid atmospheric installation:

- `src/atmosphere_model.py` – 1D atmospheric column model  
  (height, temperature, pressure, conceptual energy, resonance index).  
- `src/run_simulation.py` – script that runs a demo and saves plots to `output/`.

Run the demo locally:

```bash
python -m src.run_simulation
The script will generate output/atmospheric_profile.png with four panels
(temperature, pressure, energy potential, and resonance index vs height).
